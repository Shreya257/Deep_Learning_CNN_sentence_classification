# Deep_Learning_CNN_sentence_classification

In our experiment, fastText demonstrates superior performance compared to other models. The code can be found in `cnn_sentence_classification.ipynb`. Our findings closely align with those reported in Kimâ€™s paper.

Since the original implementation by the authors was in PyTorch, transitioning from TensorFlow involved a learning curve. However, we successfully adapted and leveraged unsupervised pre-training of word vectors to enhance overall model performance.

Our study involves convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained on pre-trained word vectors for sentence-level classification tasks. We demonstrate that a straightforward CNN with minimal hyperparameter tuning and static vectors achieves outstanding results across various benchmarks. Fine-tuning task-specific vectors further enhances performance. Additionally, we propose a simple architecture modification enabling the utilization of both task-specific and static vectors. Our CNN model is built and trained using PyTorch. Our results underscore the significance of unsupervised pre-training of word vectors in deep learning applications for natural language processing (NLP).
