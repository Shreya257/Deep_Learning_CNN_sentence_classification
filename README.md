# Deep_Learning_CNN_sentence_classification
In our experiment it can be seen that fastText outperforms the other models by quite some way. 
For the code use (cnn_sentence_classification.ipynb) . Our results are pretty close to Kimâ€™s paper result.
The implementation by the authors was in PyTorch, and introduced a learning curve, having only worked in TensorFlow. 
For larger datasets, the model takes longer to train, which was an issue while using a local system, hence we have used Google Colab.
The model can take advantages of unsupervised pre-training of word vectors to improve overall performance.
